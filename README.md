Repo Overview
=============

The repo contains the logic required in C++ for a **simple** implementation of a rBST. 
This includes the functions: 
1. insert
2. contains
3. delete

Extra Info
----------

This time around I didn't include templates like with my iterative rendition on BST (check out [this](https://github.com/Idris-Elmaliki/Binary-Search-Tree-Cpp) repo), but that wouldn't require too much to add. 

In addition, I didn't include the destructor for the rBST class since I have yet made an implemetation that doesn't create a SIGABRT exception...
